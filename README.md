# Akaru: Enlightenment Through Reading
What is Akaru?
Akaru is a digital library that allows readers to read in a way that is engaging, and that is easy and fun.
Akaru aims to bridge a gap between the reading experience and ease of use. Through the vast amount of books that are available, we want to ensure that users have a good experience and that they learn something new.
