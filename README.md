# Akaru: Enlightenment Through Reading
What is Akaru?
Akaru is a digital library that allows readers to read in a way that is engaging, and that is easy and fun.
Akaru aims to bridge a gap between the reading experience and ease of use. Through the vast amount of books that are available, we want to ensure that users have a good experience and that they learn something new.

# Deployment
**NOTE:** Akaru is easy to deploy, however it should be noted that you can't add users as this is only limited to code owners/admins
- First install packages by doing `npm install` or `pnpm install`.
- Then do `npm start` or `pnpm start`, this will open a browser and start the server.
- When logging in you can use the account `test@email.com` with the password `test123`.
    > This is one of the test accounts that we have.
